## Acknowledgments

As I am still learning javascript, its really great to find developers in which explain in so much detail and you can really grasp and understand why and how they are coding. I really enjoy [TsbSankara](https://www.youtube.com/@tsbsankara) Youtube channel because of the way he explains so well and I see just how uncomplicated (I just overthink things too much) javascript is. Much of the code I did take from his example from another project, but I feel as if I can understand more how coding works through his tutorial.
